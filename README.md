# SATVDS - Scene aware traffic violation detection system

Our Scene-Aware Traffic Violation Detection System dynamically understands road conditions and camera contexts, enabling robust violation detection in real-world scenarios. Unlike older systems, ours adapts to varying scenes, lighting, and traffic flow. With threaded processing and optimized models, we reduce computation time while maintaining high accuracy. Scene-awareness reduces false positives and makes the system viable for smart cities and real-time deployment.
